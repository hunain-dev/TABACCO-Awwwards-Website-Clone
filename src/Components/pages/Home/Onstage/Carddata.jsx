With a voice described by The New York Times as ‚Äúhypnotic,‚Äù Nabiyah has made her mark on international stages, from her role in the award-winning musical Hadestown , to her appearance in the Emmy-winning series Daisy Jones & The Six and a film role in Marvel's Black Panther .But now it's time for her own story And it starts here. The album O QUE O SOL QUER is an intimate and powerful author album, in which Nabiyah Be is guided by the symbolism of the sun and the snake‚Äîsigns of life force, metamorphosis and self-healing. Spread over fourteen original songs, in English and Portuguese, the listener is taken on a journey through desires, vulnerability, courage and rebirth. The title track sounds like a soft ray of sunshine, while songs like EVERYBODY , PO√áO AZUL and HERO mark a new era in her musical evolution. Presented live during her EP Live in Rio , these songs form the prelude to the album, and symbolize the power of change. An experience in TOBACCO TOBACCO Theater provides the perfect setting for this multi-layered, sensory musical experience.",

How he had to make choices that no one should ever have to make. And how those few months changed him forever. Thirty years later, he stands there. Not as a hero, not as a victim, but as a human being. With stories that continue to grate, with hope that must be nourished again and again, and with a silent act of resistance: giving something back. Because doing nothing is no longer an option.This piece is moving. Not only because it looks back, but precisely because it feels so topical now. While we celebrate 80 years of freedom, we also look at places where that freedom is hard to find, such as in Gaza, in Ukraine. AF ‚Äì back to Srebrenica asks difficult questions: ‚ÄúWhat did I do?
